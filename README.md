## About Me  
I am a software developer with hands-on experience in backend systems, full-stack engineering, and cloud-native development. My work spans Java/Spring Boot services, Node.js APIs, ERP systems, and distributed application workflows. I have also built applied AI/ML and computer vision solutions on NVIDIA Jetson hardware.

I value clean architecture, reliability, and scalable design. Currently focused on enhancing my expertise in distributed systems, system design, and high-performance backend engineering.
